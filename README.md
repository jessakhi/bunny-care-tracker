# 🥕 Bunny Care Tracker

A **fun, cute, full-stack web app** to help track the daily care of my pet rabbit 🐇.
This project is both my **first big portfolio project** and a way to practice **modern web development** skills while building something useful and adorable.

I designed all assets (icons, pixel art, UI elements) myself using **Piskel** 🎨✨.

## 🎯 Goals

This project is about **learning by building**.
I want to practice:

* ✅ **Frontend:** React (with modular components, cute UI).
* ✅ **Backend:** Node.js & Express.
* ✅ **Database:** (start with Local Storage ➝ upgrade later to SQLite/MongoDB).
* ✅ **Charts:** Chart.js or Recharts.
* ✅ **Planning & Calendar:** FullCalendar or a custom lightweight calendar.
* ✅ **Clean Code:** Modular structure, reusable components.
* ✅ **Portfolio:** Showcasing a project that mixes design, frontend, and backend.
